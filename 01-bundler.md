# Chapter 1: Bundler

* Enter the following command:
```
bundler gem (name of gem)
```
* When prompted on the tests to use, select rspec.  (There are tutorials on the gem creation process, and most of them use RSpec.  Also, I prefer Minitest for Rails projects, so selecting RSpec for Ruby gems broadens my know-how.)
* When you are asked about whether you wish to license your code under the MIT license, enter "y" for yes.  (If there is any specific reason you do not wish to do so, then enter "n" for no.)
* When you are prompted on whether to include a code of conduct, enter "y" for yes.
